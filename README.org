* marking mode

  Major mode for MARKING.txt files. It will try to find it's way
  around the marking directory colorizing the text, making button
  shortcuts to the student code (re-buttonize with
  ~marking-buttonize~) and re-runing (~marking-rerun-part~) individual
  parts of the marker.

* Nice to have

  - Automatic path shorcuts similar to compilation-mode.
