* marking mode

  Major mode for MARKING.txt files. It will try to find it's way
  around the marking directory colorizing the text,

  - making button shortcuts to the student code (re-buttonize with
    ~marking-make-buttons~)
  - re-runing individual parts of the marker. ~marking-rerun-part~
    will rerun the part in which the cursor is located. This uses the
    first virtualenv named ~venv~ it finds walking up the directory
    tree.
  - Kill all buffers related to a submission
    (~marking-kill-submission-buffers~)
  - Jump to a sane implementation (good_samle) of the function in
    which the cursor is in (~marking-open-good-sample~).

* Nice to have

  - Automatic path shorcuts similar to compilation-mode.
